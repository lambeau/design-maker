# design-maker

This is intended to be a way to generate random designs.

It utilizes the turtle module and Python 3.

### How it works

The plan is for there to be a library of patterns that is randomly combined in such a way to create unique designs.

### Available patterns

##### Polygon created from circles

This creates a regular polygon by specifying the circumradius and number of sides. Circles are drawn with a diameter equal to the edge length at each of the corners.
